  "description": "This is the home of Babass itself. This difficulty is much more legendary, way more important than the Primordials. It is Ethereal. You don't understand how difficult this difficulty is. If you took TFinD and compared it… I don't even know what it would be. It probably wouldn’t even be comparing TFirD to TFinD, so nothing even exists at this magnitude. If you managed to beat the rest of the chart combined, this will be your true stopping point. Why? Because there's literally nothing after this. This is your end. Nobody is beating this.",
