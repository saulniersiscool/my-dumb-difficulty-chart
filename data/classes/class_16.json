  "description": "To begin a difficulty in this class... well, it is hard to say where to begin. Many of these difficulties at this point would contain catches that would contradict the natures of difficulties themselves, making themselves even more of an abstract concept, except now even more indecipherable than before. To even enter a Class 16 difficulty would be a grand achievement. In difficulties like these, there may be catches that prevent the player from accessing the difficulty; for example, there may catches stating that the player must complete the next difficulty to access the difficulty, or that they are not allowed to enter the difficulty, but yet have to complete it to advance. This class also used to be the final class in the difficulty chart before the chart was extended to 32 classes, and then to 35. Then, the Extermination happened, causing the chart to shrink to 24 classes, along with this class being changed to Class 16.",
