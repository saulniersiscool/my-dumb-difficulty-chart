People who beat towers of this class of difficulties are considered to be \"Elite Obbyists\". Many people beat towers such as Tower of Difficulty Chart, Tower of Double Trouble, or Tower of Thinning Layers as their first towers in this class. A lot of towers in this class are mostly purist, but plenty of towers in this class are based around client objects. Almost every tower in Pit of Misery is in this class range as well. People who make it to difficulties that are this deep are very good at obbies, whether they have 30 or 250 towers beaten. People on the higher end of Class 3 have beaten many towers in the top list, which might only be Terrifying/Catastrophic or have even beaten the hardest towers verified, that is, Tower of Blind Fate and Citadel of Infinite Void. Many tiered obbyists, are in this class. For context, tiered obbies are purist that usually do not have a frame, and have their own dimensions. They are usually the same length as EToH towers.

Obstacles in this class are still possible to do, but in some cases they are barely possible. This class also contains most of EHT, which is EToH’s Hardest Towers. Bottom Class 4 towers may be possible to beat, but the near-impossible obstacles present like RNG makes them practically humanly impossible.

It is also known as the red zone, due to every difficulty here being red-colored, as it was blasted into the volcano. Good luck, since these difficulties will be brutal, being past what was thought to be the limit of gameplay as a whole. Also, random history facts! This class is a combination of previous class 6 (which started at Malicious and ended at Vicious, which was after Mischievous) and the first part of class 7, which was also known as the red zone. As a result, the icons of all the difficulties residing in the previous class 6 were changed to become red, and now class 6 looks super cool being red!

Many of these difficulties at this point would contain catches that would contradict the natures of difficulties themselves, making themselves even more of an abstract concept, except now even more indecipherable than before. To even enter a Class 16 difficulty would be a grand achievement. In difficulties like these, there may be catches that prevent the player from accessing the difficulty; for example, there may catches stating that the player must complete the next difficulty to access the difficulty, or that they are not allowed to enter the difficulty, but yet have to complete it to advance. This class also used to be the final class in the difficulty chart before the chart was extended to 32 classes, and then to 35. Then, the Extermination happened, causing the chart to shrink to 24 classes, along with this class being changed to Class 16.",

It probably wouldn’t even be comparing TFirD to TFinD, so nothing even exists at this magnitude. If you managed to beat the rest of the chart combined, this will be your true stopping point. Why?
