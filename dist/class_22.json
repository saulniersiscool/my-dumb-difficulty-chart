  "description": "This class is reserved for The Final Difficulty, and nothing more. People say this has a rating of 100, but no, that is Vrery hawrfd rdifficutl!!. 250? No, that is Penultimate. This, my friend, is infinity; the supremum of all finite numbers. The finale of this chart is located alone here because it simply cannot be overshadowed or compared to, at least on this wiki. Even if you have an infinite amount of separate unique catches, none can even get close to THIS.. Nonetheless, this is the end, also called Class ∞. Welcome to Class 22 | Finale, your ending place that you simply cannot continue from. Anything that is apparently harder than this is said difficulty.",
